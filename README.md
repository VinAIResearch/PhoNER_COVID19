## COVID-19 Named Entity Recognition for Vietnamese

PhoNER_COVID19 is a dataset for recognizing COVID-19 related named entities in Vietnamese, consisting of 35K entities over 10K sentences. We define 10 entity types with the aim of extracting key information related to COVID-19 patients, which are especially useful in downstream applications. In general, these entity types can be used in the context of not only the COVID-19 pandemic but also in other future epidemics:
